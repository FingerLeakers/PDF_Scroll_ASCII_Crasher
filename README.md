# PDF_Scroll_ASCII_Crasher

A PDF that crash Adobe Reader,  just a little discovery that i want to share.



<b>ON WORKING!!!!!!!!!!</b>

Like many things, this too, was discovered by accident....

I was intent on creating graphics made entirely of ASCII characters, and in the various steps to make them "marketable," </BR>
one involved converting them from .html to .pdf files.

Once I opened the pdf to see its contents, I immediately noticed that something was wrong.... </BR>
The pdf was displayed very slowly and if I tried to scroll down the page the program would start to glitch, </BR>
and quado I tried to close the pdf the program (Adobe Reader, to be precise immediately crashed.</BR>
Interesting...</BR>
